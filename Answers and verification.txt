  Fix:
    Switch2:
      Config t
      Interface range g0/1-2
      No channel-group 1 mode desirable
      Channel-group 1 mode active
  Verification:
    Output of “show etherchannel 1 summary” should show port-channel 1 using LACP and both ports Gi0/1 and Gi0/2 should have a “(P)” beside them.
    Switch1 should successfully be able to ping 10.3.1.2

Objective 2:
  Fix:
    Switch1:
      Config t
      Interface port-channel1
      Switchport trunk allowed vlan add 2
  Verification:
    Output of “show spanning-tree vlan 2” should include port-channel 1.
    Router3 should be able to successfully ping 10.2.2.2.

Objective 3:
  Fix:
    Router4:
      Interface g0/1.1
      Standby preempt
      Standby priority 150
  Verification:
    Output of “show standby” on Router4 should include “Preemption enabled”, “Active router is local”, and “Standby router is 10.2.2.3”

Objective 4: 
  Fix:
    Router3:
      Config t
      Router ospf 1
      No passive-interface g0/0
  Verification:
    Output of “show ip ospf neighbor” on Router3 should include 10.1.3.1 as a neighbor.

Objective 5:
  Fix:
    Router4:
      Config t
      Interface g0/0
      Ip ospf network point-to-point
  Verification:
    Output of “show ip ospf neighbor” on Router4 should include 10.1.3.1 as a neighbor.

Objective 6:
  Fix:
    Router1:
      Config t
      Router bgp 65001
      Neighbor 10.1.1.1 remote-as 65002
      Network 1.1.1.1 mask 255.255.255.255
    Router2:
      Config t
      Router bgp 65002
