# NetworkingInterviewLab
A simple Cisco networking lab for testing job candidates skills.

This was built in EVE-NG (http://eve-ng.com) for the purposes of testing the skills of a job candidate for a Cisco Network Engineer position. It contains a fairly simple topology that should test the candidates skills in troubleshooting trunk links, port-channels, HSRP, OSPF, and BGP.

The topology was built using vIOS and vIOSL2 images.
